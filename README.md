# QIIME-Workflow
QIIME workflow for analyzing microbial community composition using V3 16S rDNA paired end Illumina sequences.

An ordered list of QIIME scripts to analyze bacterial community composition from 16s rDNA paired-end reads from an Illumina sequencer. The scripts are ordered as starting from merging paired-end reads, picking OTUs and also include the scripts for the external FAPROTAX application. QIIME script for creating input files for Cytoscape is also mentioned.
